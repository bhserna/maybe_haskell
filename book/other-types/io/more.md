### Learning more

There are many resources online for learning about `Monad` and `IO` in Haskell.
I recommend reading them all. Some are better than others and many get a bad rap
for using some grandiose analogy that only makes sense to the author. Be mindful
of this, but know that no single tutorial can give you a complete understanding
because that requires looking at the same abstract thing from a variety of
angles. Therefore, the best thing to do is read it all and form your own
intuitions.

If you're interested in the origins of monadic I/O in Haskell, I recommend
[Tackling the Awkward Squad: monadic input/output, concurrency, exceptions, and
foreign-language calls in Haskell][spj] by Simon Peyton Jones and [Comprehending
Monads][wadler] by Philip Wadler.
