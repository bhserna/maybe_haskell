## Wrapping Up

And thus ends our discussion of monads. This also ends our discussion of
`Maybe`. You've now seen the type itself and three of Haskell's most important
abstractions, which make its use convenient while still remaining explicit and
safe. To highlight the point that these abstractions (`Functor`, `Applicative`,
and `Monad`) are *interfaces* shared by many types, the next and final section
will briefly show a few other useful types that also have these three
interfaces.
