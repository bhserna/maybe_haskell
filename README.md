# Maybe Haskell

A book about Haskell's approach to the `null` problem.

## I need help

Opening PRs and waiting for LGTMs does not seem to work. I end up merging them
without much review. I need review of this content because it's at the limit of
my teaching abilities: complicated stuff aimed at beginners.

If you see an open PR please review it. However, if content is in master that
doesn't necessarily mean it's been looked over. Please, if you have the time,
pull down the repo, generate the PDF, and read over a chapter or two.

Provide feedback to me in [Trello][], [GitHub][], email, or in person.

Here's how:

- Clone this repo and [paperback][] side-by-side
- Go into this repo
- Run `bundle install`
- Run `bundle exec paperback preview`

[github]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/maybe_haskell/issues
[paperback]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperback

Thanks!
